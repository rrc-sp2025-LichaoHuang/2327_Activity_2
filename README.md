## Additional Information

[ Practiced creating an abstract class and using this abstract class to create a usable class.
  Unittest was performed on the two child classes (rectangle and triangle) respectively. 
  Create instances of these two classes and put them into a list. Use this list to output the shape information, area, and perimeter.]

[Since I forgot to do version control while working on the activity, all the timestamps and steps in this version control were added after I finished the activity. I did all the work on this activity myself. If you have any questions about my code while marking, I'm happy to answer them. Please don't deduct points for my git commit time.]
